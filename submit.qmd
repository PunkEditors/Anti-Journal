## Why?

You already upload it online, you already have a DOI via Zenodo, why submit here? Just to show up!

## Acceptance rates

We won't accept just anything. We want to highlight papers that are open and reproducible, and that think in un-conventional ways to publish. Dynamic papers with updated versions, is something we are interested in.

## How?

As easy to fill in this [issue](https://github.com/PunkEditors/Anti-Journal/issues/new?assignees=ibartomeus&labels=&template=new-paper.md&title=Submit+a+paper+to+the+Anti-Journal) with the minimal information.

## Is there are peer review process?

Of course not. Peer review is out of control. We \[aim to\] use plaud.it to allow the community to judge how trustable is the paper and highlight the most interesting ones, BUT you are the only one who can assess if a paper is valid.
